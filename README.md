# Kerbonaut Manager

A mod that adds a window to the VAB where you can create new kerbonauts or rename/remove your existing ones.
It also prevents your kerbals from disappearing when you recover their vessel, and it stops the VAB from generating
random kerbals whenever their count drops below a certain number.

## How to use

When you open the VAB Kerbal Manager, the mod window will open automatically next to it. By default you will see
the option to create a Kerbonaut - either fill in your desired Kerbal name, or leave it empty for a random one to be
generated. Right clicking on a kerbal in the Kerbal Manager window will open them in the mod window to allow renaming or
deleting.

If you want the mod window to close at any time, you can do so using the "x" button in the top right corner, and if you
want to access it again without closing and reopening the Kerbal Manager, you can do so from the main toolbar in the
bottom right of the game window.

## Known issues

- Creating a new kerbal with a custom last name will prevent a VAB portrait to be generated for them.  
  **Workaround**: Create the kerbal with the last name "Kerman" first, and then right-click them and edit their
  last name afterwards.
